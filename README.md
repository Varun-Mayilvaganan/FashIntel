# FashIntel
A deep learning-based project designed to classify fashion products from images. The model leverages computer vision techniques to predict key attributes of a product, such as its color, type, preferred season, and target gender (Men, Women, or Unisex).

## Use Cases:
1. E-commerce platforms can automate product tagging for better recommendations.

2. Fashion trend analysis to understand seasonal or gender-based shopping patterns.

3. Personalized shopping assistants that suggest products based on images uploaded by users.
